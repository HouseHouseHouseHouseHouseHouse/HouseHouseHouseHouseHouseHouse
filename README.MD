# Good morning!
I am Jacob Bates, a Computer nerd who really likes low-level assembler stuff.
My favorite platform to write for is ARM (I've done some assembler programming on a Raspberry Pi), but I also like working with x86 a lot.
I've been programming for nearly seven years, but I've been working with assembler for a little under two years as of December 2020.
I'm currently working on [my own real-mode DOS](https://github.com/HouseHouseHouseHouseHouseHouse/House-DOS).
I've been working on it for a few months, and hope to continue to get it to a v1.0 or even v2.0 sometime.
I like exploring the different concepts for OS development, which is why I started this project.
